#Machine Learning Naive base algorithm implementation
## multinomial-and-binomial-implementation
Jupyter python notebook implementation of multinomial and binomial classification. Here a simple classification is carried out to find the class of the given text.Classes are as Educational or Cinema. Dataset is created by own and anyone can create their own dataset for any classes. 
Detail of the code is shown in the program itself and is easy to understand.
First, Multinomial is implemented with the dataset that gives the probability for cinema and Second, the higher probability is same for Cinema. The file(example_test.csv) is used to predict the class of a text.That is higher the probability of a class then, it is classified correctly. The screenshot is also shared .
